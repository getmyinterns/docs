## How to Review and Approve Students

:::warning

This step is only necessary if you have activated it from **_Settings_** > **_General Settings_**. (See [Settings - General Settings](/school-admins/settings#enable-student-approval) for more info). **If not activated, students will be able to register and directly use the system**.

:::

:::info

You can choose which admin roles can approve/decline `Students` from **_Settings_** > **_General Settings_**. (See [Settings - General Settings](/school-admins/settings#roles-allowed-to-approvedecline-pending-students) for more info).

:::

Every time a new `Student` registers, `Admin Users` (see [Admin Users](/school-admins/system-configuration#admin-users) for details) will receive an email.

1. Click on **_Pending_** > **_Students_**.

Tap on either the First Name or Last Name of the student to review and edit data such as students `Details`, `Workflow`, `Seasons`, etc. (see [System Configuration](/school-admins/system-configuration) for more info)

The students need to be approved for each active season they have applied to, either from the list of students, since each student will appear once for each season he has applied to, or from the `Seasons` tab.
