## How to Set Up Your Provider Profile

After registering, you may need to choose a [`Season`](/glossary#season) to apply to, if there are more than one active `Season` available.

![Choose Season](images/choose-season.png)

To apply to more than one `Season`, just click on the active one on the menu bar at the top of the screen and choose. Once you have chosen the `Seasons`, or if there was just one active `Season`, please wait to be approved to start using the platform.

Click on **_My Info_** to edit your info or reset your password if needed.

In the **_Forms_** page you will find any forms and documents related to the program.

The **_Job Posts_** page will show you the `Job` posts you have already filled in for the chosen `Season`, and you can see and edit the details of each one by clicking on their title. You can add new ones by clicking on **_Add Job_**. Use the filter to toggle between `Seasons` if you have applied to more than one, or narrow your search.

:::info

`Industry` is the field of the `Job` offered or of the company/organization. You can use this to let the `Student` know in which field they will be carrying out their duties.
