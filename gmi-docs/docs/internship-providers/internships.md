# Finding and Managing Interns

In order to apply for internships the `Account Administrator` needs to approve you after [registering](/internship-providers/getting-started#registering-as-an-internship-provider).

If you have applied for more than one `Season`, you can toggle between active `Seasons` from the top menu.

## How to Search for Interns and Offer Jobs

Click on **_Hire - Find Interns_**. You can select `School`, [`Area of Study`](/glossary#area-of-study), Grade, Radius and exclude `Students` who you already scheduled an interview or offered an `Internship`. For multiple selection, press the Ctrl or Shift key or CMD, depending on your device.

Clicking on **_Offer Job_** or **_Reject_** will prompt a confirmation message.
