# Interviews

In order to apply for internships the `Account Administrator` needs to approve you after [registering](/internship-providers/getting-started#registering-as-an-internship-provider).

## How to Schedule Interviews with Students

Click on **_Hire - Find Interns_**. You can select `School`, [`Area of Study`](/glossary#area-of-study), Grade, Radius and exclude `Students` who you already scheduled an interview or offered an `Internship`. For multiple selection, press the Ctrl or Shift key or CMD, depending on your device.

If the `School/District` has added an `Event`, you will have the option to schedule the interview during that `Event`. Some `Schools/Districts` have student conferences type of events and take the opportunity to perform quick interviews with organizations such as yours.
