You can schedule an `Interview`, offer the `Job` directly or **_Reject_** the application, from the buttons on the right.

When scheduling an `Interview`, you will see the `Student's` availability, and you can choose location, date and time.

The `Student` will receive an email with the details. You will receive an email if the interview is cancelled.
