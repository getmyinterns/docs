Enter the initial date of your `Internship` week and start filling in your data by ticking each day box. The columns to be filled may differ from the ones in the image, depending on the needs of your `school/district`.

Lastly click on **_Save_** or **_Save and Submit_**. Ask your school coordinator about the process (submitting at the end of each week, month, etc.).

## Viewing Past Timesheets and Statuses

Each `Timesheet` consists of an entire week. Just click on the desired date to open the details of that timesheet. Click on **_Edit_** to continue filling out or modifying your timesheet. When done click on **_Save_** to save it as a draft or **_Save and Submit_** to submit it for review. Edition is only available when the `Timesheet` has not been submitted yet, or if it has been rejected.

You can see the Status at the bottom left corner. In case the `Timesheet` is rejected, you will receive an email, and you can go back to edit it and resubmit.

Click on the **_Notes_** tab to check if there are any notes for you from your supervisor.
