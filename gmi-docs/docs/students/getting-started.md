The **Academy** is an `Area of Study`, a category or field in which you focus your academic and internship pursuits. Since different schools/districts have different names for it, you may find a different name for the **Academy** field in the picture above. Some schools/districts call them `Academies`, `Pathways`, `Tracks`, `Concentrations`, etc.

## How to Set Up Your Student Profile

After registering, you will need to wait for your school's coordinator to approve your registration. In the meantime you can upload your resume. `Internship Providers` will be able to see it.
